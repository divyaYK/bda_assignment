## Problem Statement

- Estimate the Probability of success in a deal show.<br>
One experiment consists of following.<br>
  – A contestant is presented with three doors.<br>
  – Behind one of them is a valuable prize.<br>
  – After contestant chooses a door, host opens one of the<br>
  other two doors (not the one containing the prize)<br>
  – The contestant is then given the choice to switch to<br>
  the other unopened door.<br>
  – Assume that contestant switches to other door.<br>
- <strong>Input</strong><br>
  – i/p 1: number of mapped instances<br>
  – i/p 2: number of tries<br>
- <strong>Output</strong><br>
  – o/p: average of all mapper outputs

#### Steps to run:

Locally:<br>
