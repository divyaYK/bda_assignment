## Problem Statement

- Estimate golden ratio using Fibonacci series. One <br>
experiment consists of following. Program starts<br>
with any two random positive integers less than<br>
M. Compute Fn and Fn+1 Fibonacci numbers (n is<br>
given as input). The golden ratio is computed as<br>
Fn+1/Fn.<br>
- <strong>Input</strong><br>
  – i/p 1: number of mapped instances<br>
  – i/p 2: number of experiment tries.<br>
  – i/p 3: number of items N in Fibonacci series<br>
  – i/p 4: Max value M of initial random +ve integer<br>
- <strong>Output</strong><br>
  – o/p: average of all combined outputs<br>
